The Idea :

Synapp aims to create the marketing optimization cloud. Bridging the gap between marketing analytics,
optimization, and big-data platforms and the digital marketing platforms. 

Synapp takes enterprise level data analytics, intelligence and optimization and makes it available to 
the SMB market as actionable optimization workflows within their current platforms. 

The Market:

There is a 44 Billion plus yearly spend by SMB's on digital marketing services such as email and social. 
The average SMB spends $17,000 a year on these services and more than 50% intent to spend even more next year. 
48% percent intent to focus their spending on tools to help them optimize their targeting, segmentation and 
overall customer engagement. 

The Problem:

This SMB market is vastly under served when it comes to marketing optimization. The solutions that exist are 
cost prohibitive, complex and do not work with their current marketing vendors. SMB's are left drowning in a 
sea of marketing data with no way of discerning true insights and implementing real optimization. 

The Opportunity:

Synapp can become the go to solution for this vastly under served market. Providing a simple method through 
which businesses can take the vasts amount of data they have and turn it into real actionable insights 
within their current marketing platforms. 

The Challenge:

We are looking to build a lean team of passionate talented individuals who are ready for the adventure of a lifetime. 
If this sounds like you here is what we are looking for :

1) Web Application Developers
- We are looking for some of the brightest and most passionate developers out there who are looking to join a cutting edge startup. 
We want developers who are rock star coders, down to earth people and tired of the status quo. If you are an amazing developer who

2) Investors & Partners 
- No one can do it alone and we are no exception. If you are a savvy angel, vc, or private investor who wants to join us in building
a revolutionary company in one of the fastest growing market segments then please reach out. We don't just want your money; we want
